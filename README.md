Task: Develop a Flask Web Application for House Price Prediction Using a Machine Learning Model

Overview: The House Price Prediction Web App is a machine learning-based Flask application that predicts house prices based on user-input features such as median income, house age, average rooms, and occupancy. The project utilizes Linear Regression trained on the California Housing Dataset to provide price estimations
To set up the project, first,navigate to the project directory. Then, create a virtual environment using python -m venv venv and activate it based on your operating system. Next, install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. Once dependencies are installed, train the model by running python model/train_model.py, which generates a model.pkl file storing the trained machine learning model.
To start the application, run python app.py and open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser. The app features a user-friendly web interface where users can enter house details and receive a predicted price instantly
